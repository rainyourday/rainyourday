*STATUSES (READ THIS BEFORE INT) ,,*

🌙 ; I usually use this moonie rather than 🟢, and that means I’m around ! Feel free to interact, chat, or just vibe. BUUUUT I might be semi-AFK, your odds of getting a reply are high if you do whisper instead. C+H is always welcome, encouraged even, unless stated otherwise (like DNI, DNIUP, DNIUCF, etc).

⛔ ; Means I’m caught up in stuff or not in the mood to socialize. Please interact with extremely care when I’m in this state :( Often non-verbal, but I appreciate your company if you do come.

I’m a gacha kid, yapp a lot, do art, yadda yadda .. I’m shy at first sight, awkward too, don’t take my jokes seriously ! I do talk a lot once comfy enough, so bear with me.

Friend me on Discord if you want ; (/rainyourday_).

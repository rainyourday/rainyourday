*. STATUSES (READ THIS BEFORE INT) ,,*

🌙 ; I usually use this moonie rather than 🟢, and that means I’m around ! Feel free to interact, chat, or just vibe. BUUUUT I might be semi-AFK too, so your odds of getting a reply are high if you do whisper instead. C+H is always welcome, encouraged even, unless stated otherwise (like DNI, DNIUP, DNIUCF, etc).

⛔ ; Means I’m caught up in stuff or not in the mood to socialize. Please interact with extremely care when I’m in this state :( Often non-verbal, but I appreciate your company if you do come.

I’m a gacha kid, yapp a lot, do art, yadda yadda .. The stuff.

Friend me on Discord if you want ; (/rainyourday_).

                                   ..  𝗖𝗛𝗔𝗣𝗧𝗘𝗥  III  :    THE DEAD LINE.

*. THINGS TO NOTE ::*

- As stated before, you can int with me freely, just be respectful.
- I’m shy at first sight, awkward too. I do talk a lot once comfy enough, so bear with me.
- Don’t demand nor expect too much from me as I might not meet up to your expectations.
- You can approach me even when I’m with friends, but be mindful of their pony’s name ; if there’s no C+H, I’d prefer you don’t.
- I’m a multishipper. My main ships are Paycheck, Doublefedora, and Frozendebt.
- Proshippers DNI. No questions asked.
